
Platform:

Users often ask what the differences are between Read the
Docs Community and Read the Docs for Business.
While many of our features are available on both of these
platforms, there are some key differences between our two
platforms.

Important Features of the Read the docs:


• Open source project hosting is always free
• All documentation sites include advertising
• Only supports public VCS repositories
• All documentation is publicly accessible to the world
• Less build time and fewer build resources (memory & CPU)
• Email support included only for issues with our platform
• Documentation is organized by projects
